ipkg is a Python library and command line tool to create and manage runtime
environments for various software.

It is like Homebrew, also working on Linux, and with so few packages.
It is like virtualenv, with pip included, and using software from any source.
It is currently under heavy development. Thanks for your patience. :-)
